#### GO B7  - It is my graduate work.

An information app with a convenient interface for viewing various services in Be'er Sheva from different categories,
Such as 
 - [x] bars, 
 - [x] restaurants, 
 - [x] food, 
 - [x] parks, 
 - [x] attractions.
 
By selecting a category, the user will see the location of the institutions on the map, selecting the interest option, you can see the description of the place and all the necessary information about the place - name, rating, opening hours, phone number, official website, address and ability to get directions through Google Map.
 Adding/deleting and updating user locations is just some of the options that the app gives. The practicality lies in the fact that everyone can use their places privately. If necessary you can add them globally, after controlling and confirming the reality of the place - it will be visible to everyone. There are lots of categories from domains various, such as food, shopping, bars, clubs, parks, dog parks, interesting places of the city, water coolers, city fountains, and trash cans.
